## **Project Workflow**

### 1. User Instruction
User types a natural language command like:


"Draw a circle in the center"


### 2. Agent Interpretation (GPT-5)
The GPT-5 Agent converts the command into structured JSON steps.

### 3. Auto Execution on Canvas
 
Steps are executed live.

Canvas dims, tool highlights.

Shape appears instantlyâ€”no drag & drop required.

### 4. Transcript Logging

Each action is logged with:

Timestamp

Step description

Small canvas preview

### 5. Interactive Transcript

Hover over a transcript step to replay that exact action visually.

### 6. Sequential Multi-step Execution

Complex commands (e.g., "Draw a triangle inside a circle & color it red") are broken into sub-steps.

Each sub-step is executed sequentially and logged.

### 7. Export Transcript

At session end, users can export:

Session title

Step list with timestamps

Screenshots/previews after each step (PDF/Word)

### 8. Replay Session (Optional)

Full session replay like a time-lapse for review.

In short:
CoachAI takes natural language â†’ auto-executes on canvas â†’ logs every step â†’ lets users replay or export the session.
